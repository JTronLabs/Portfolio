[<span class="caps">S</span>o far we've covered the tech stack behind the Birdu game, and how to get a new Phaser project started using an automatic generator.
Now, we'll jump into the weeds of game creation.
Here we'll cover how to create a game state, and then move onto getting some action going in our game.

Please note, this tutorial aims to outline the main development processes involved, but maybe not every nitty-gritty detail.
The final product will be slightly different than the Birdu game that is available online, if you want to know how to implement it exactly you should checkout its [code](https://github.com/JTronLabs/Birdu).
