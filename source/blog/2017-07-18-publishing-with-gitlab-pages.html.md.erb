I've previously described how to [publish on GitHub](github-pages-custom-domain.html), but with GitLab's support of HTTPS and greater bandwidth ([GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/#usage-limits) vs [GitLab](http://disq.us/p/1gv55te)), I decided to make the switch.
HTTPS is especially important, your [SEO will suffer](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html) without it.

Both platforms allow you to publish static content (such as a blog or landing page) for free.

##Domain name

If you want to use a custom domain name (Gitlab gives you `username.gitlab.io` for free) then you need to purchase one from a domain name registrar (DNR).
I use [Namecheap](https://affiliate.namecheap.com/?affId=119129/) for their pricing, customer support, design, and their [support of an open web](https://blog.namecheap.com/namecheap-supports-net-neutrality/).
When we set up DNS records later, screen shots will be from Namecheap but the steps should be similar at any other DNR.

##GitLab Continuous Integraction

[GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/README.html), can automatically build your projects from static site generator source code.
Running from a simple [YAML config file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html), it is a good way to [quick start](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/README.html) your web site.

Unfortunately when I tried it out I didn't like it much.
Building a somewhat [big/complex blog](http://bonktothefinish.com/) takes much longer to process in GitLab's rate-limited cloud than it does on my local hardware.
My local hardware also already has all of the site's external dependencies, and does not need to reinstall them for each build.
Build errors & warnings are easier to see on a locally, and if something goes wrong they are easier & quicker to fix.

So I'm not going to get into this, but I definitely respect what they're doing and can see how it would be very useful to a lot of people.
Instead I directly upload the build/dist directly to the GitLab repo.
