I've previously described how to [publish on GitHub](github-pages-custom-domain.html), but with GitLab's support of HTTPS and greater bandwidth ([GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/#usage-limits) vs [GitLab](http://disq.us/p/1gv55te)), I decided to make the switch.
HTTPS is especially important, your [SEO will suffer](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html) without it.

Both platforms allow you to publish static content (such as a blog or landing page) for free.

    resources: "
- [GitLab Pages Overview](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/)
- [GitLab Pages Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages)
- [DNS record types](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/579/2237/which-record-type-option-should-i-choose-for-the-information-im-about-to-enter)
"

##Domain name

If you want to use a custom domain name (Gitlab gives you `username.gitlab.io` for free) then you need to purchase one from a domain name registrar (DNR).
I use [Namecheap](https://affiliate.namecheap.com/?affId=119129/) for their pricing, customer support, design, and their [support of an open web](https://blog.namecheap.com/namecheap-supports-net-neutrality/).
When we set up DNS records later, screen shots will be from Namecheap but the steps should be similar at any other DNR.
