Recently my brother needed some help converting lists of hundreds of terse addresses to their geographical coordinates and formatted street addresses.
We spent a few hours and eventually came up with a working solution using jQuery and the Google Maps API.
Using JavaScript, you can make automatic, parallel requests to Google Maps to quickly find all your places.
You can check out my example [here](/examples/GoogleGeocode.html), but I only get 1,000 free requests per day.
If it's not working open the dev tools (F12) and check the console for errors (may be over limit).
If you need more, you can get yourself a key and substitute it into the code below.

<%= partial "partials/article_links.erb", locals: {
    resources: "
- [Google Places JS Library API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places)
- [Google Places Web API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)
- [Google Maps API - Pricing and Plans](https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/#details)
- [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
- [Online Example, 1k Requests Per Day]()
"
  } %>

## Getting a API Key

API stands for [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) - in this case it is a set of tools and functions that allows us to use Google's amazing Maps functionality.
We could set up a system to [scrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) the addresses off of Google Search results, but then Google would get mad at the absurd amount of server time one user is taking, and potentially lay down an IP block.
The key is the secret password to let Google keep track of all your API calls, and apply a limit once you've reached the max for the day.
To get one, log into your Google account, visit the [Get a Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#key) site, and click the blue button that says "Get A Key".

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "api_create_new.png",
    alt: "Create a New Project",
    caption: "Once you click the button, create a new project" } %>

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "api_new_proj.png",
    alt: "Name the Project",
    caption: "Name your project..." } %>

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "api_key.png",
    alt: "save key value",
    caption: "Now you have the key! Save the value that appears in the black box" } %>

##How to get those addresses

Now that we have the key, let's check out the code.
