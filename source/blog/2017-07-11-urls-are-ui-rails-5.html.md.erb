I recently came across [this cool article](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/URLsAreUI.aspx) showing how to make URLs that don't suck.
It cross references some other articles discussing the same topic - [Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/url-as-ui/) and [Tim Berners Lee](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI).
Essentially, URLs should be shareable, shortenable, and human readable+guessable.
Lets discuss some methodologies to accomplish this in Rails 5.

  } %>

##Shareable

Rails by default uses a RESTful API, URLs contain parameters that are used to determine what to display on the page.
So it's harder to create worthless links like `homesearch.com/homes/for_sale/search_results.asp`.
Though it's definitely still possible through JS or reconfiguration, and should be avoided.

It doesn't end there.
Shareability isn't a switch, it's a spectrum, and it's affected by length and intuitiveness.
An intuitive URL is something lacking arbitrary gotchas - a user can probably guess it.
Rails does a good job with this, change the URL extension to `.json` and json will be sent.
It also promotes creating simple resources, so you avoid seemingly random URL hierarchies (e.g. `site.com/user_name/_$!projects`).

An area that rails falls flat is in long IDs.
Imagine a site that creates a lot of DB tuples such as a popular social network.
If you use an integer id, user 1,000,000 will have to type a lot of characters to share his page.
You could try ID [slugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug) using [FriendlyID](http://norman.github.io/friendly_id/file.Guide.html), but problems can arise with [duplicates](http://norman.github.io/friendly_id/file.Guide.html#Uniqueness) and [speed](https://gist.github.com/norman/1129745).
A better solution is to create alphanumeric ids using a larger [radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix).

###String Ids

URL safe, non-reserved characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and `$-_.+!*'(),`.
These 73 characters allow you to create a base 73 ID that is much shorter than a decimal number (1 billion = zfGya).
However, we need to remove some characters from our lexicon.
MiXeD cASe is possible but difficult to remember and describe, keep it all lower case.
Including both periods and commas would create an easy mixup, so lets remove '.'.
That leaves us with base 46 (1 billion=4+fv$k).

For security, IDs should also be randomized to prevent [inference attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_attack).
This is all very similar to how Youtube creates video IDs.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gocwRvLhDf8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

First, let's **setup our model** to accept a String based ID.
Let's use an "Event" model for example.
In the migration set `id:false` to disable auto-incrementing integer ids.
Then recreate the id column as a string.

~~~ruby
class CreateEvents < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :events, id:false do |t|
      t.string :id, null: false, index: true
      #...
    end
  end
end
~~~

Run the migration.
Inside the model, set the 'new' primary key.

~~~ruby
class Event < ApplicationRecord
    self.primary_key = :id
    #...
end
~~~

Our model is ready to go!

Next, let's **set up the word blacklist**.
This will ensure the alphanumeric id does not contain offensive material.
Create `lib/assets/blacklist_words.csv`, paste in [this (NSFW) filter](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words/blob/master/en), and perform whatever data cleanup you need.
For example, these words will be appearing in a URL with a max length, so you can remove all spaces and all phrases over your max length (8 characters for example).
Keeping this blacklist concise will greatly speed up ID generation.

Now we need to create the **id generation logic**.
This is not application specific - it will work for multiple resources and multiple projects - and thus should go in the `lib/` folder as well.
Create `lib/short_ids.rb` and paste in the following code.

~~~ruby
module ShortIds
    @radix = ('0'..'9').to_a + ('a'..'z').to_a + ['$','-','_','+','!','*','(',')',','] #URL safe, lowercase characters

    #Load blacklisted words from CSV into an iterable data structure
    @blacklist = File.read(Rails.root.join('lib', 'assets', 'blacklist_words.csv')).split('\n')
    #require 'csv' #if you have a more complicated CSV setup
    #@blacklist = CSV.parse(@blacklist, :headers => true, :encoding => 'ISO-8859-1')

    # Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9827498/why-does-the-fixnumto-s-method-in-in-ruby-only-accept-radixes-from-2-to-36
    # generate string representation of integer, using digits from custom alphabet
    # [val] a value which can be cast to integer
    # [digits] a string or array of strings representing the custom digits
    def self.custom_radix_to_s val, digits
        digits = digits.to_a unless digits.respond_to? :[]
        radix = digits.length
        raise ArgumentError, "radix must have at least two digits" if radix < 2

        i = val.to_i
        out = []
        begin
        rem = i % radix
        i /= radix
        out << digits[rem..rem]
        end until i == 0

        out.reverse.join
    end

    #Create an unused id for a given model
    def self.new(model, max_len=7)
        id=0
        max = @radix.length**max_len #what is the highest value given a set number of characters? For base 10 and 3 characters, it's 10*10*10 = 10**3
        loop do
            id = rand(1..max) #choose random ID in allowed range
            id = ShortIds.custom_radix_to_s(id, @radix) #convert base 10 ID to custom base

            #ensure no bad words in ID
            id_bad=false
            @blacklist.each do |word|
                id_bad = id.include? word
                break if id_bad #choose a new id if this one has a blacklisted word
            end
            break if not id_bad and not model.exists?(id) #stop looking for ids if this id is unique and safe
        end
        return id
    end
end
~~~

Notice `@radix`, this defines our id vocabulary.
If you don't like my character choices, feel free to add uppercase and such back in.
The `self.custom_radix_to_s` method was copied from a [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9827498/why-does-the-fixnumto-s-method-in-in-ruby-only-accept-radixes-from-2-to-36) and transforms a base 10 number to a new base using a custom radix vocabulary.
Finally, the `self.new` method puts it all together.
It creates a random ID in the given range, converts to proper radix, ensures it does not contain profanity, is unique, and returns the value.
Note that the id is not a fixed length.
For a base 46 ID of <=8 characters you can create 46^8+46^7+...+46^1 = 2.049311473×10¹³ unique IDs.

To use our new lib file the module and filename must follow Rails naming conventions (which they do) and it **must be autoloaded** in `config/application.rb`:

~~~ruby
module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.autoload_paths << Rails.root.join('lib')
    #...
  end
end
~~~

Finally, let's ensure the Event **model uses the new id**.
Open `app/models/event.rb` and add a `before_create` function to auto-assign ID.

~~~ruby
class Event < ApplicationRecord
    self.primary_key = :id #remember this from above?
    before_create :set_id

    private
        def set_id
            self.id = ShortIds.new(Event)
        end
end
~~~

There you have it!
An alphanumeric short ID for an Events model.
Note that what Youtube and the [recommended method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9600816/ror-generate-an-alpha-numeric-string-for-a-db-id) does is create a table, populate it with available+random IDs, and periodically recreates IDs as the table runs low.
This preallocation saves some processing time as the user is waiting.
I leave that as an exercise to the reader.

##Shortenable

As mentioned previously, pure slugged URLs are undesirable due to speed and duplication issues.
But URLs should definitly be readable, otherwise the user doesn't know what they are clicking on.
Stack overflow manages this well with user accounts, notice what happens to the URL when you navigate to <https://stackoverflow.com/users/4180797>.
It auto-completes to <https://stackoverflow.com/users/4180797/james-lowrey>.
Actually, you can put anything after the ID and it will always become "james-lowrey": <https://stackoverflow.com/users/4180797/bad-word-filters-are-fun>.

Let's get the same setup in Rails.

Once we're done, we'll have multiple routes pointing to the same resource.
Be sure to assign [canonical URLs](https://github.com/jumph4x/canonical-rails) else you might get an SEO hit.

###Shortenable Show Action

First step is to **fix some routing**.
We want to accept garbage after the id in a resource's show action.
This ensures `resource/id/anything-here` will not 404 and instead will be redirected to `resource/id`.

~~~ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :events
  get "/events/:id/*other" => "events#show" #if any txt is trailing id, also send this route to events#show
end
~~~

Next, let's **obtain readable text from the model**.
If you want a resource to have readable text URLs, there should be some field to pull it from.
Let's assume your Events model has a `name` field, and pull from that.
So `name` must be defined in the migration.

~~~ruby
class CreateEvents < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :events do |t| #works with string or integer ids
      t.string  :name, null: false
      #...other stuff...
    end
  end
end
~~~

Now we should **parse and modify URL requests**.
Let's again place our logic in the `lib/` folder (so ensure the autoloader is on as described in previous section).
Create `lib/shortenable_urls.rb` and paste in the following:

~~~ruby
module ShortenableUrls
    def self.redirect_for_readability?(request, id, readable_txt_parameterized)
        #check if column_name is not seen in the URL of an HTML request
        if request.format.html? #do not care how URL looks for json/data requests
            id = id.to_s

            #parse out the URL text following the id
            url = request.original_url
            id_end_indx = url.index(id) + (id).length + 1 #+1 for '/' character

            #URL txt after id does not match readable_txt
            if url[id_end_indx..-1] != readable_txt_parameterized
                return true
            end
        end

        return false
    end
end
~~~

This stateless function requires the request, the object id and the object's parameterized readable text.
It parses out the text following the id and returns whether or not it matches the expected text.

Finally, we should **redirect** in `Events#show` if an incorrect value was in the request.

~~~ruby
class EventsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    readable_txt = @event.name.parameterize
    if ShortenableUrls.redirect_for_readability?(request, @event.id, readable_txt)
      redirect_to "/events/#{@event.id}/#{readable_txt}"
    end
  end
  #...other stuff
end
~~~

And you're done!

Entering `/events/id/ANYTYHING` or `/events/id` will always redirect to `/events/id/name`.
Note that this can also be accomplished [client side with JS](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45021521/4180797), and thus you could you use page `<title>` or any other text, but it would break on browsers with JS disabled.

###Resources Aliasing

Let's say Event is your only resource that begins with the letter 'e'.
Seems like it would be useful to provide `/e` as an alias to `/events` (this is common for sites to do with `/users` and `/u`).
Thankfully this is much simpler than the other things we've encountered thus far.

Open up your `config/routes.rb` and add an events alias.
Be sure to accept garbage after the show action just like you did for Events, otherwise the route will break on URLs like `/e/id/ANYTHING-HERE`.

~~~ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :events
  get "/events/:id/*other" => "events#show" #if any txt is trailing id, also send this route to events#show

  #alias the "events" routes
  resources :e, controller: 'events'
  get "/e/:id/*other" => "events#show" #if any txt is trailing id, also send this route to events#show

  #...other stuff...
end
~~~

Now `/e` URLs will have the same actions as the Events resources.
They will even redirect to readable text if you followed the previous section's instructions.

Be careful with aliases though.
The worst thing you can do is break links, so you should be absolutely certain you want these aliases before you push to prod.
