I was recently listening to [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/), and caught [this interview](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/03/31/webassembly-with-brendan-eich/) with [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla.
In it he discusses his vision for the future of the web, including his work on [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) (a faster web language) and [Brave](https://brave.com/) (a new browser).

Brave sounded interesting: it automatically blocks all trackers, mediated ads, and cookies, and [replaces the ads](https://brave.com/about_ad_replacement.html) with its own.
Sounds sketchy, but is actually kind of genius.
Ads that are manually placed by publishers/content creators are left alone (e.g. a static image in the site, amazon affiliate link, shoutout in a podcast), only those that go through the slow loading and [fradulent](http://adage.com/article/digital/ana-report-7-2-billion-lost-ad-fraud-2015/302201/) digital ad mediation industry are replaced.
Once a user has seen/clicked a Brave ad, the revenue is divided up in the following manner:

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "https://brave.com/assets/img/contents/ad_money.png",
    alt: "Brave rev share" } %>

Notice that the user gets a cut!
This is paid out via Bit Coin (they partner with [BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com/)), and users have the choice of withdrawing it or funneling it into their Brave Payments system.
Over time it remembers what sites you visit and distributes your earned or deposited bit coin proportionally to your favorite sites.
It does all this [without saving](https://brave.com/FAQ.html) your data to external servers.

##Chrome Comparison

To test it out, went to a [random Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/catescottcampbell/2017/05/08/the-limit-does-not-exist-creative-brainpower-and-badass-women-in-stem/#370283616e63) and watched the network impact (hit F12, go to Network tab) as the page loaded (on my wired 60mpbs connection).
I did not scroll or click anything on the page, and had cache disabled (so subsequent views wouldn't be sped up).
The longer and more frequent the bars, the more data is loaded into the page.
The following images give a rough outline of the impact of ad blockers; be sure to note the time scales.

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "forbes_chrome_unblocked.png",
    alt: "Forbes Article Unblocked Chrome",
    caption: "Chrome, Ads allowed (similar in Brave)" } %>

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "forbes_chrome_ublock.png",
    alt: "Forbes Article ublock Chrome",
    caption: "Chrome, uBlock Origin" } %>

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "forbes_brave_ads.png",
    alt: "Forbes Article Brave ads",
    caption: "Brave, Brave Ads" } %>

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "forbes_brave_block.png",
    alt: "Forbes Article Brave Block",
    caption: "Brave, Ads blocked" } %>

This data, while small, shows some interesting conclusions:

1. Data wise, actual content is a small part of the page
2. If you don't have a 60mpbs, wired connection, you could be waiting a long time for ads
3. Brave seems to have an edge up on uBlock Origin. Makes sense, as Brave has lower level access (browser vs plugin)
4. Brave Ads and Brave, No Ads seem to have nearly indistinguishable load times. This could be because all ads are still being blocked - Brave [doesn't replace every ad](https://brave.com/FAQ.html), or due to the faster ad selection process (described in the podcast).

As for rendering, games, and that sort of thing, Brave uses the same engine as Chrome, [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)).
Like Chrome and Firefox, [Brave is open source](https://github.com/brave).
