[Polymorphic Associations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_association) help relate one database class to multiple other classes.
In Rails this helps when one model can `belongs_to` multiple other models.
A common example is an Address, without polymorphic behavior it would need to belong to every possible table, and would lead to a lot of wasted DB space and bad code.

~~~ruby
class Address < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :person
  belongs_to :company
  belongs_to :event
  #MORE and MORE belongs_to
end
~~~

Polymorphic associations allow us to have much cleaner code and databases.

~~~ruby
class Address < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :addressable
end
~~~

In this article we'll show you how to set up migrations, models, and forms for a simple polymorphic association - a `has_one` address.

People have a lot of issues with Polymorphic associations -
[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34552688/rails-4-polymorphic-associations),
[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41655645/ruby-on-rails-polymorphic-association-with-categories),
[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34225576/polymorphic-and-has-one-association),
[4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42405660/polymorphic-association-creating-a-record),
and more.
And many of those questions do not have an accepted answer, despite the seeming abundance of guides on the matter.

So without further ado, let's begin:

~~~ruby
rails g scaffold Events name:string
rails g model Address address:string addressable:references{polymorphic}
~~~

##Migrations

Open the new `***_create_addresses.rb` migration and edit the 'references' line to add in an index.

~~~ruby
t.references :addressable, polymorphic: true, index: true
~~~

[References](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations) is an alias to creating both a foreign key and type column, made specifically for polymorphic behavior.
It is equivalent to:

~~~ruby
t.integer :addressable_id
t.string  :addressable_type
~~~

`addressable_id` references the "parent" association that `has_one`, `has_many`, etc of Addresses.
For us, this will be an Event id.
`addressable_type` saves the name of the parent, for us it'll be "event".
The Rails docs demonstrate this relationship with the following image:

<%= partial "partials/image.erb", locals: {
    src: "polymorphic_tables.png",
    alt: "Polymorphic Tables",
    caption: "Polymorphic Imageable tables" } %>

Notice something here?
**YOU CANNOT HAVE MIXED ID TYPES!**
Sorry for yelling, it's just I've just made this mistake.
Inside the Pictures table you can see that `imageable_id` is an integer.
This forces the employees and products tables to use integer IDs as well.
However, there are [lots of good reasons to use string ids](/blog/urls-are-ui-rails-5.html#string-ids).

If one parent/consuming table has a string ID and participates in a polymorphic association, all other parent tables in that association must also have string ids.
For example, if we changed Employee's ID to a string, we would also need to change Product's ID and Picture's `imageable_id`.
Furthermore, this would prevent us from being able to use `references` in the Imageable migration (since it aliases an integer).
You would need to manually define the two columns:

~~~ruby
t.string :imageable_id, index: true
t.string :imageable_type, index: true
~~~

Anyways, now that that's out of the way, our migrations are looking good.
Time to migrate!

~~~ruby
rake db:migrate
~~~

##Models

The Address model is already OK, and will contain a nice `belongs_to :addressable` line.
The Event model must be edited to create the address association, and to [accept nested attributes](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html) for the address in its form

~~~ruby
class Event < ApplicationRecord
    has_one :address, as: :addressable
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :address
end
~~~

##Views

I really like [simple-forms](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) so let's go ahead and install that before mucking around in Rails forms.
Add `gem 'simple_form'` to the `Gemfile` and `bundle install`.
Open `app/views/events/_form.html.erb` and replace the file with a simple_form.

~~~ruby
<%%= simple_form_for @event do |f| %>
  <%%= f.input :name %>

  <%%= f.simple_fields_for :address do |address| %>
    <%%= render :partial => 'shared/address/form', :locals => {:f => address} %>
  <%% end %>

  <%%= f.button :submit %>
<%% end %>
~~~

Notice the field for an address?
Let's create that next.
Make a new file and name it `app/views/shared/address/_form.html.erb`.
This file is rather simple:

~~~ruby
<%%= f.input :address %>
~~~

What we've done is created a [nested form](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#nested-forms) for an Address inside the Event form.
This nested form is rendered using [partials](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials), which allows us to reuse the address form in any associated view and maintain a single point of control.
The Event form is rendering the nested address form with the `simple_fields_for` line, and the partial with `render :partial`.

With the forms all taken care of, let's ensure the address will be displayed when we are inspecting a given Event.
Open `app/views/show.html.erb` and add in the following display code somewhere in the file.

~~~erb
<p>
  <strong>Address:</strong>
  <%%= @event.address.address %>
</p>
~~~

##Controllers

Finally, let's string everything together in the event controller - `app/controllers/events_controller.rb`.
First we must modify the [strong params](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#strong-parameters) to accept the nested address fields, so the `event_params` function must be edited.

~~~ruby
# Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.
def event_params
  params.require(:event).permit(:name, { address_attributes: [:address] } )
end
~~~

Finally, an address must be created when the [new](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2472393/rails-new-vs-create) action is called.
This ensures the address's fields will be displayed when the address form is rendered in `site.com/events/new`.

~~~ruby
# GET /events/new
  def new
    @event = Event.new
    @address = @event.build_address
  end
~~~

Seems like we're done right?
Not quite.

##Troubleshooting

If you run your project (`rails s`), navigate to `/events/new`, and attempt to create an event it won't work.
On the the terminal running rails, you'll see something like this

~~~bash
Started POST "/events" for 127.0.0.1 at 2017-07-13 14:52:27 -0400
Processing by EventsController#create as HTML
  Parameters: {"utf8"=>"âœ“", "authenticity_token"=>"zo5fvibHtpivjqseJ+AL4ToTTg8fUzSuXxuyvYzdfj6fUZfq7Y0x584Y/fXRSnWffvCLdaJV2J0vkp273GbB6Q==", "event"=>{"name"=>"some name", "address_attributes"=>{"address"=>"some address"}}, "commit"=>"Create Event"}
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
   (0.0ms)  rollback transaction
~~~

Why is this happening?
To find out, let's go back to the event controller and insert a [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) statement after an event save fails

~~~ruby
def create
  @event = Event.new(event_params)
  respond_to do |format|
    if @event.save
      format.html { redirect_to @event, notice: 'Event was successfully created.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @event }
    else
      byebug #<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ADD THIS
      format.html { render :new }
      format.json { render json: @event.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
~~~

If an error occurred when saving an event (ie our transaction was rolled back), byebug will halt server execution and open the terminal to that line.
Try to save an event again, and notice a prompt appears in the terminal:

~~~bash
[32, 41] in /~/polymorphic-rails/app/controllers/events_controller.rb
   32:       if @event.save
   33:         format.html { redirect_to @event, notice: 'Event was successfully created.' }
   34:         format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @event }
   35:       else
   36:         byebug
=> 37:         format.html { render :new }
   38:         format.json { render json: @event.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
   39:       end
   40:     end
   41:   end
(byebug)
~~~

We can use this prompt to find the issue.
Typing in `@event.errors` yields

~~~bash
#<ActiveModel::Errors:0x007f54fa167258 @base=#<Event id: nil, name: "some name", created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>, @messages={:"address.addressable"=>["must exist"]}, @details={:"address.addressable"=>[{:error=>:blank}]}>
~~~

It appears our address does not know to whom it belongs.
Remember, addressable_id is a foreign key designating who the address belongs_to, in this case an Event.
If it is missing, this belongs_to relationship will be parentless.

Rails 5 recently made the belongs_to association [require a parent by default](http://blog.bigbinary.com/2016/02/15/rails-5-makes-belong-to-association-required-by-default.html), but there seems to be an issue with assignment before saving.
This seems to be a [bug](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/29781) on Rails part.
It looks like a chicken or egg problem, if you disable this validation it'll save, and if you check for addressable after save finishes you'll find it just fine.

To get around this, you can turn off the Address model's (`app/models/address.rb`) validation check:

~~~ruby
class Address < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :addressable, polymorphic: true, optional:true
end
~~~

OR you can leave the validation check on and manually assign addressable in event#create (`app/controllers/events_controller.rb`).
I would go with this option.

~~~ruby
def create
  @event = Event.new(event_params)
  @event.address.addressable = @event #<<<<<<<<<<< ADD THIS
  respond_to do |format|
  if @event.save #Saves the event. Addressable has something to reference now, but validation does not know this in time, thus it has to be done manually above
      format.html { redirect_to @event, notice: 'Event was successfully created.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @event }
    else
      #dont forget to remove the 'byebug' that was here
      format.html { render :new }
      format.json { render json: @event.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
~~~

Let's check that it works.
Insert a `byebug` into the event controller's show action.
Now navigate to `/events/new` and submit a completed form.
Byebug will halt execution as the form redirects to a 'show' page.
Ensure that everything is playing together nicely:

~~~bash

Looks good!

So there you have it.
You can check out the code for this project [here](https://github.com/JarLowrey/polymorphic-rails).
It's unfortunate that things break without making them `optional`, but it seems to be a current weakness of Rails.
Thanks for checking out the guide and good luck!
